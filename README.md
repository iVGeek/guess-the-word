# Guess the Word Game

This game employs JavaScript to iterate through arrays, employ appropriate methods, employ regular expressions, and access an external API.

Extra features have been incorporated, including a scoring mechanism, a maximum length restriction on the text input, disabling autocomplete, deactivating the "Guess" button if the text field is empty, and the implementation of media queries.

## How to Play
The game commences with a word displayed on the screen, where circular symbols serve as indicators for each letter. Participants initiate by inputting a letter. If their guess is accurate, the letter is revealed within the word; otherwise, they are informed of the remaining number of guesses. Additionally, players have visibility into the letters they've previously guessed. The game provides feedback if a letter has already been guessed or if a non-alphabetic character is entered.

Should the player successfully guess all letters before exhausting their 8 allotted attempts, they emerge victorious! After the game, a "Play Again" button prompts the player to engage in another round.
